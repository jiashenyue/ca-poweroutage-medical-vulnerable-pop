This notebook shows how to separate long form of time series into power outage events.
Power outage event is defined as a power outage last longer than 10 min and affects more than 0.5% customers in the area of interest.

- Clean work space.

# Obtain household data

- Customers are defined as households in this work.

```{r}
if(any(grepl("package:plyr", search()))) detach("package:plyr",unload = TRUE) else message("plyr not loaded")

  "california_county_demographics.csv"),stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
total_hh %>% DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE)
```

# Fill missing values

- Obtain long form file names

```{r}
long_form_fnames <- list.files(path = here("data_private",
                                           "long_form_missing_flg_fixed_county"),
                               pattern = "\\.csv$")

n_long_form <- length(long_form_fnames)
```

- Function to separate long form time series into power outage events
    - Detailed steps are described in the comments of code block

```{r}
generate_tile_plot_df <- function(long_form,customers_out,curr_total_hh){
  
  param_grid <- expand.grid(
    c_out = customers_out
  )

  for (i in 1:NROW(customers_out)){

    # If Customer out of power = 0, use a different condition to filter the subset data
    if (param_grid$c_out[i] == 0){
      long_form %>%
        filter(CustomersOut == param_grid$c_out[i]) -> curr_ts
      
      
    }else{
      long_form %>%
        filter(CustomersOut >= param_grid$c_out[i],
        ) -> curr_ts
      
    }
    

    # Obtain flags to separate the entire time series 
    # 1) if the time stamp is not consecutive (b/c the curr_ts is a subset from the long-form)
    # curr_ts$FlagCustomer <- c(0,diff(curr_ts$CustomersOut_Sum)) != 0
    # Note that this is different from the previous vesion
    # of script, which also judges if there is a change in customer out
    
    curr_ts$FlagTime <- c(10,diff(curr_ts$date)) > 10
    
    # Combine the two flags to get a general flag to separate the curr_ts into segments
    # Each segment contains the same number of customers out of power & the timestamps are consecutive
    curr_ts <- curr_ts %>%
      mutate(Flag = ifelse((FlagTime),TRUE,FALSE)) %>%
      select(-FlagTime)
    
    n_seg <- length(which(curr_ts$Flag))+1
    
    curr_ts$SegID <- NA
    curr_ts$SegID[which(curr_ts$Flag)] <- seq(1:n_seg)
    
    # Add back the first flag to the first row of curr_ts
    curr_ts$SegID[1] <- 0
    curr_ts$SegID = curr_ts$SegID+1
    curr_ts$SegID <- as.factor(curr_ts$SegID)
    
    # Number of segments (n_seg) = the number of consecutive rows with 
    # more than 0.5% total customers out of power (customers_out, varies)
    # by county
    # This value varies between each parameter combo
    
    curr_ts$NumSeg <- n_seg
    
    # Fill the segment ID
    curr_ts <- curr_ts %>% fill(SegID)
    
    # Record the maximum # of customer during the outage 
    # and the total minutes of duration (sum of segments * 10 min)
    # Duration in curr_ts = minutes of outage
    curr_ts <- curr_ts %>%
      group_by(SegID) %>%
      mutate(SegCustomerOut = max(CustomersOut,na.rm = TRUE),
             Duration = 10*n(),
             CustomerMinutes = sum(CustomersOut,na.rm = TRUE)*
               Duration)
    
    curr_ts <- curr_ts %>%
      group_by(SegID) %>%
      summarize(SegID = first(SegID),
                SegCustomerOut = first(SegCustomerOut),
                SegCustomerMinutes = first(CustomerMinutes),
                Duration = first(Duration),
                Start = first(date),
                End = last(date)+ms("9:59")) %>%
      mutate(CustomerThres = param_grid$c_out[i])
    
    # Calculate % of total housing units who have experienced power outage
    # Calculte % of time of the year when a power outage have occurred
    curr_ts <- curr_ts %>%
      mutate(PctHU = SegCustomerOut/curr_total_hh*100,
             PctTime = Duration/525600*100,
             TotalHU = curr_total_hh)
    
    # Drop unrealistic segmentations with % HU out of power > 100
    curr_ts <- curr_ts %>%
      filter(PctHU<100)
    
  }
  
  return(curr_ts)
}

```

- Loop over each county to convert long form data to power outage events

```{r}

for (f in 1:n_long_form){
  
  if(any(grepl("package:plyr", search()))) 
      detach("package:plyr",unload = TRUE) 
    else 
        message("plyr not loaded")

  
  # Read long form data of a county
  long_form <- read_csv(here(
    "data_private",
    "long_form_missing_flg_fixed_county",
    long_form_fnames[f]))
  
  curr_county <- substr(long_form_fnames[f],1,nchar(long_form_fnames[f])-14)
  
  # Get housing unit information from county level data `total_hh`
  curr_total_hh <- total_hh[startsWith(total_hh$NAME,curr_county),]
  curr_total_hh <- curr_total_hh$TOTHU_CY
  
  # Get the new definition of outage:
  # Customers out = 0.5% of total households in the unit of analysis
  customers_out <- ifelse(round(curr_total_hh*0.005,0)<500,
                          500,
                          round(curr_total_hh*0.005,0))
  
  print(paste0("Working on ",curr_county," County"))
  
  curr_df <- generate_tile_plot_df(long_form,
                                        customers_out,curr_total_hh)
  
  # Prepare saving to external file
  # Binding results for each county together
  
  col_names <- names(curr_df)
  curr_df <- bind_cols(curr_county,curr_df)
  names(curr_df) <- c("County",col_names)
  if(f == 1){
    df_out <- curr_df
  }else{
    df_out <- bind_rows(df_out,curr_df)
  }

  
}                               

```


- Write to external file
```{r}
write.csv(df_out,
          here("result",
               "ca_pct_household_oop_new_def.csv"),
          row.names = FALSE)
```
